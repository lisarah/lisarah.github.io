title: Set-based Markov Decision Process (MDP)

My latest manuscript, "Set-based value operators for non-stationary Markovian environments", is live at [arxiv/2207.07271](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07271).

In this manuscript, I analyze robust dynamic programming from a novel set-based perspective, and derive value function sets that are invariant to changes in an MDP's cost and transition parameters.
