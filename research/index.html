<h2>Master Thesis:TinyML for Solar Panels: Bringing Edge Computing Applications to Solar Energy Systems</h2>
<h4>August 2020</h4>
  <p>In this work, we work on novel applications of edge computing for Solar Power Systems for 1)Identiﬁcation and Estimation of Power Loss of Solar Panels
2)Classiﬁcation of Soiling on Solar Panels and 3)Solar Irradiance Forecasting through Sky Images:</p></br>

<h2>ACL 2019: Pre-trained BioBERT with Attention Visualisation for Medical Natural Language Inference</h2>
<h4>August 2019</h4>
  <p>This paper explores the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) for solving MedNLI. The proposed model, BERT pre-trained on PMC, 
PubMed and fine-tuned on MIMICIII v1. 4, achieves state of the art results on MedNLI (83.45%) and an accuracy of 78.5% in MEDIQA challenge.</p>

<h2>Convolutional Neural Networks In Classifying Cancer Through DNA Methylation</h2>
<h4>July 2018</h4>
  <p>A CNN based Deep Learning model that can classify the cancer of a new DNA methylation profile based on the 
    learning from publicly available DNA methylation datasets</br></p>

<h2>Compositional Attention Networks for Interpretability in Natural Language Question Answering</h2>
<h4>October 2018</h4>
  <p>We propose a modified MAC net architecture for Natural Language Question Answering. Question Answering typically requires Language Understanding and multi-step Reasoning. 
    MAC net's unique architecture-the separation between memory and control, facilitates data-driven iterative reasoning.</p>

<h2>Gallium Nitride Power Device Modeling using Deep Feed Forward Neural Networks</h2>
<h4>May 2018- IEEE WIPDA ASIA</h4>
  <p>this work proposes deep feed forward GaN ML device models which are highly accurate and can predict the switching behaviour of the device without having to delve 
    into the physics and geometry of the device.</p>
