Design Optimisation for an Efficient Wireless Power Transfer System for Electric Vehicles
============

**Description**:
Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has been used to transfer small amounts of power over small distances to run smartphones, RFID tags, smart watches and even biomedical implants without any electrical contact. A popular application for this is the wireless charging of electric and hybrid electric vehicles. However, designing systems to send large amounts power over large distances while maintaining appreciable efficiency is hard to do. In this paper, an overview of a typical WPT system has been given. Simple design equations have been given to calculate inductance, capacitance, power, quality factor and coupling coefficient to optimise coil design for electric vehicle application. Further, a comparison has been made between the popular coil shapes and the effects of the change of coil parameters like number of turns, pitch and inner and outer radius on efficiency of the coil has been studied.
