I am a final-year PhD candidate in the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at the University of Washington, working with Behcet Acikmese and Pierre-Loic Garoche. 

I study scalable multi-agent autonomy under competition, specifically in the areas of robotics, urban transportation, and air traffic management. My research combines techniques from optimization, control theory, and game theory to develop theoretical frameworks that scalably integrates autonomy into existing infrastructure in urban, air, and space traffic management.
