I am a final-year PhD candidate in the department of <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/">Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at the University of Washington</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese">Behçet Açıkmeşe</a> and <a href="https://garoche.net/">Pierre-Loïc Garoche</a>. 

I optimize large-scale, multi-agent autonomous systems in uncertain environments, specifically in the areas of <h_text>robotics</h_text>, <h_text>urban transportation</h_text>, and <h_text>air traffic management</h_text>. My research combines techniques from optimization, control theory, and game theory to develop frameworks that scalably integrates congestion-free autonomous behavior into existing infrastructure in urban, air, and space traffic management.
