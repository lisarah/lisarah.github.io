I am an assistant professor in the <a href = "https://www.ae.gatech.edu/">School of Aerospace Engineering</a> and a member of the <a href = "https://research.gatech.edu/robotics">Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM)</a> at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I was a postdoctoral scholar at ETH Zurich. I completed my PhD in  <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/">Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese">Behçet Açıkmeşe</a> and <a href="https://garoche.net/">Pierre-Loïc Garoche</a>. 

<br>
I am interested in improving the coordination and control of interacting dynamical systems with an emphasis on optimality, scalability, and robustness.  My research combines techniques from optimization, control theory, and game theory to develop models and algorithms for applications including   <h_text>urban transportation</h_text>, <h_text>advanced air mobility</h_text>, and <h_text> space collision avoidance</h_text>.

<br>
I am looking for prospective graduate students interested in advanced air mobility, supply chains, and space traffic through the lens of:
