I am a postdoctoral scholar at the <a href = "https://control.ee.ethz.ch/">Automatic Control Laboratory, ETH Zürich</a>, working with John Lygeros and Florian Dörfler. Before this, I completed my PhD in  <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/">Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese">Behçet Açıkmeşe</a> and <a href="https://garoche.net/">Pierre-Loïc Garoche</a>.

<br>
I am looking for prospective graduate students interested in advanced air mobility, supply chains, and space traffic through the lens of:

  <li>Game Theory for Safety-critical Operations <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17690">[1]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16223">[2]</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9817454">[3]</a></li>
  <li> Stochastic Control for Forecast-driven Systems <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01090">[1]</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9773091">[2]</a></li>
  <li> Orbital Decision-making under Epistemic Uncertainty </li>
</ol></em>
Please apply through <a href = "https://ae.gatech.edu/ae-graduate-apply">Georgia Tech AE</a> and indicate your interest in working with me. If you have specific interest/experience with any of the topics listed above, please send me an email.

I optimize large-scale, multi-agent autonomous systems in uncertain environments, specifically in the areas of <h_text>robotics</h_text>, <h_text>urban transportation</h_text>, and <h_text>air traffic management</h_text>. My research combines techniques from optimization, control theory, and game theory to develop frameworks that scalably integrates congestion-free autonomous behavior into existing infrastructure in urban, air, and space traffic management.
