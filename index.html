I am a postdoctoral scholar at the <a href = "https://control.ee.ethz.ch/">Autonomous Control Laboratory, ETH Zürich</a>, working  with John Lygeros and Florian Dörfler. Before this, I completed my PhD in  <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/">Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese">Behçet Açıkmeşe</a> and <a href="https://garoche.net/">Pierre-Loïc Garoche</a>.

I am looking for prospective Ph.D. students interested in game theory, trajectory optimization, and reinforcement learning for mobility systems and space traffic. Please apply through <a href = "https://ae.gatech.edu/ae-graduate-apply">Aerospace Engineering</a> and indicate your interest in working with me.

I optimize large-scale, multi-agent autonomous systems in uncertain environments, specifically in the areas of <h_text>robotics</h_text>, <h_text>urban transportation</h_text>, and <h_text>air traffic management</h_text>. My research combines techniques from optimization, control theory, and game theory to develop frameworks that scalably integrates congestion-free autonomous behavior into existing infrastructure in urban, air, and space traffic management.
